# Homebrew formula for aegis (REL-006/007).
#
# Installs the aegis binary + its bundled harness (OpenCode, ripgrep, config-seed,
# llama-server) into the keg's libexec, and a bin/aegis wrapper that points aegis at that
# libexec (AEGIS_LIBEXEC, REL-005). The model GGUF is side-loaded separately (air-gap) — it
# is far too large for a bottle and must come via the staging flow, not brew.
#
# Tap usage:  brew install rtmx-ai/tap/aegis   (github.com/rtmx-ai/homebrew-tap)
#
# `version`, the per-platform `url`s, and `sha256`s are filled in at release time from the
# dist/aegis-<version>-<os>-<arch>.tar.gz bundle tarballs (scripts/release.sh). This template
# lives in the source repo; REL-007 publishes a filled copy to the tap as Formula/aegis.rb.
